Interesting Topics:
1. Sorting. It's like an arms race to see who can read a list the fastest and I like reading about it. 
2. Simulation. I like the sims it's in my blood
3. Optimization. Same reason as sorting. It's really fun to make the absolute smallest possible program you think you're capable of making. I always think about that screenshot of Mario on the NES that was larger than the entire rom with this topic and it blows my mind.
4. Low level programming. It's interesting seeing the building blocks that created the foundation for everything we can do on computers today. It's one of the big reasons I'm excited for this class. To learn more about the parts that make our rainbow gaming monoliths.
5. Game design. This is what I got into CS for. I like programming little games. Most of my projects I do outside of class are also little games (though that's also just because when I try to do something ultilitarian like a finances sheet then I get bored that I can't play with it and give up)

Difficult Topics
1. Data reallocation. Whenever this comes up in C code I am at a complete loss on how to get it to work. I've somehow passed every other cs class without ever having my malloc and realloc code working on the assignments.
2. pointers. I understand them in theory but can never think of how to utilize them in my actual projects. This is mostly probably that I don't work with enough data to need them in most projects right now
3. Sorting. I understand a lot of the basic algorhithms we covered in class but it's a complex topic.
4. AI. Obviously if I don't grasp pointers then working with datasets as large as would be required for AI and being able to program that to work with a GUI is very high concept.
5. Calculus. This isn't really computer science but I've taken like 4 calculus classes in the name of this degree (and failed many of them) so I assume it counts and I hate it with all of my heart
